  Our project aims to recreate Git Version Control. Users on our application will be
  able to work on files simultaneously. We will provide users with the ability to create
  and maintain repositories stored on local computers. Users will be able to clone and pull
  repos, create branches, edit files, commit, add, push, merge, and deal with
  merge conflicts with reverting edit history. 

  Additonally, we are looking into store projects in an actual database, allowing for
  multi-user collaboration with a GUI that users can view repo history.
